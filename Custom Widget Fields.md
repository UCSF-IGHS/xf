# Custom widget fields

Widgets are now going to be customsiable with more options.

## Table widget

* `dynamic:yes` 
Indicates whether the table should be a dynamic table, 
which means it can be sorted. Other features may depend on this
setting being enabled

* `allow_downloads:yes`
Indicates that this table widget allows the download of its data. If
enabled, it allows for CSV, Print and Copy to clipboard.
